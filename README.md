# Human Computer Interface Research

## Grading Project:
- Semester Project (40% of overall grade – broken down below): There is a semester-long project that gives you an opportunity to develop the full

- High Fidelity Prototype (5 %) - Working prototype 
- Iteration /polished product (6%) – Documentation that illustrates the notable changes/lessons learned from the first Iteration and the user 
studies

## Phase:
- Phase 1 – Form Group and Project ✅
- Phase 2 – Requirements and First Prototype
- Phase 3 – Test and Evaluate
- Phase 4 – Implement changes, finish

## Tasks
- Form Groups ✅

- Requirements
- Design Alternatives
- Prototypes
- Testing Design/ Evaluating Design
- [Presentation](#)
- Final Deliverables
