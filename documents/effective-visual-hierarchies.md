# Effective Visual Hierarchies

## I. Introduction:
Creating effective visual hierarchies for websites is extremely important for web users.
In fact, humans try to search for wanted information in the shortest amount of time
Therefore, Designing good visual hierarchies structures will help the users to navigate their information faster. 

## II. Conventional web pages
- Do not reinvent the wheel for just minor changes. Reinventing the wheel usually result in revolutionary new rolling
devices. I agree to the author statements: Innovate when you know you have a better idea, but take advantages of 
conventional when you don't 
- There are web design convention structures that designers should follow. 
- Conventions have also evolved for different kind of sites (e-commerces, colleges, restaurants...) because 
each category solve similar problems.
- For example: 

#### 1) Where things be located on pages:
- Logo: logo identifying the website to be in top-left corner.
- Primary navigation: across the top or down the left side
- Search box: top right
- Links: are shown below header
- Links: are shown for navigation
- Content: on the left
- Comment: bottom
- Additional info, categories, archives: on the right

#### 2) How Things work:
- shopping cart icon: consistent through all pages
- methods of payments: mostly the same through all pages

#### 3) How things look:
- sharable link, video link, hyper link
- button shadow

## Basic Effective Visual Hierarchies:
- Make the relationship between each section is clear
- Important section (e.g. title) should be in a different format (refer to 1)
- Content Structure must be consistent (at least in the same websites)
- Dividing the page into clearly defined areas allows users to decide quickly which area can focus and which one can't
- There are basic rules that we should follow when design content structures

#### 1) The more important something is the more prominent it is:
- The more important elements: larger, bolder, distinctive color, set off more white space...
- Example:

<img src="/images/prominent.jpg" width="300" height="300">

#### 2) Things that are related logically are related visually
- Show thing that are similar in the same visual style
- Show thing that are similar in a clearly defined area
- Example:

<img src="/images/related.jpg" width="300" height="300">

#### 3) Things  are nested visually to show what part of what
- Example:

<img src="/images/nested.jpg" width="300" height="300">

- The author mention visual hierarchies has been there for a long time (examples of new paper).
He also mentions that "a good visual hierarchy save us work by preprocessing its contents in a way that we can grasp almost instantly".
